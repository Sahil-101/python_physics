# Simulation of ball dropped with horizontal velocity and coefficient of restitution #

A Python Code to simulate the behaviour of a rigid ball bouncing on the floor dropping from a
height of 4 m and having a velocity of 1 m/s in the positive x axis direction. Consider the following

x-y scatter graph showing the trajectories of the ball for the coefficient of resititions 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,0.8.

Instruction to Run:
    pip install matplotlib
    python ball_fall.py

:) Happy Coding :)
